  linoleum


Once in linoleum, to execute a shell:
  File->Open
  double-click on "ScriptShell"


To install an application (or any Ivy module), in the script shell:

To build linoleum from itself, first clone the repository by external means (for now), then in the script shell:
  cd("/path/to/linoleum");
  mkdirs("build/classes");
  javac("src/main/java", "build/classes");


To publish an application:

- add net.java.linoleum#application;1.0 to your project's dependencies
- implement linoleum.application.Application
- make it available to the service loader in META-INF/services
- publish your artifact in maven central
- let me know so that I put it in the list (below)


To use linoleum as your desktop environment in Linux:
  sudo cp linoleum.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/
